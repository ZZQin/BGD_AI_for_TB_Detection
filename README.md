# Can artificial intelligence (AI) be used to accurately detect tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-rays? An evaluation of five AI products for TB screening and triaging in a high TB burden setting

Summary 
Background 
Artificial intelligence (AI) products can be trained to recognize tuberculosis (TB)-related abnormalities on chest radiographs. Various AI products are available commercially, yet there is lack of evidence on how their performance comparesd  with each other and with radiologists. 

Objective 
We evaluated five AI software products for screening and triaging TB using a large dataset that had not been used to train any commercial AI products. 

Methods
Individuals (≥15 years old) presenting to three TB screening centers in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were recruited consecutively. Every participant was verbally screened for symptoms and received a chest x-ray (CXR) and an Xpert test. All CXR were read independently by a group of three Bangladeshi registered radiologists and five commercial AI products: CAD4TB (v7), InferRead®DR (v2), Lunit INSIGHT CXR (v4.9.0), JF CXR-1 (v2), and qXR (v3).  We compared the performance of the AI products with each other, with the radiologists, and with the Target Product Profile (TPP) of triage tests. We developed a new decision analytic framework that simultaneously evaluates sensitivity, Xpert saving, and number needed to test to inform implementers’ of choice of vendor and threshold selection. 
 
Findings 
All five AI products significantly outperformed the Bangladeshi radiologists. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve wereare qXR: 90·81% (95% CI:90·33-91·29%), CAD4TB: 90·34% (95% CI:89·81-90·87), Lunit INSIGHT CXR: 88·61% (95% CI:88·03%-89·20%), InferRead®DR: 84·90% (95% CI: 84·27-85·54%) and JF CXR-1: 84·89% (95% CI:84·26-85·53%). Only qXR and CAD4TB met the TPP with 74·3% and 72.9% specificity at 90% sensitivity respectively. Five AI algorithms can reduced the number of Xpert tests required by 50% while maintaining a sensitivity above 90%. All AI algorithms performed worse among the older age groups and people with prior TB history. 
 
Interpretation 
AI products can be highly accurate and useful screening and triage tools for TB detection in high burden regions and outperform human readers.
